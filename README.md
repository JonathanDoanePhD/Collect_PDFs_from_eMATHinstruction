# Collect_PDFs_from_eMATHinstruction
 Use automated mouse/keyboard controls to collect hundreds of PDF files, then merge them into logical categories for printing.


The "script" file performs actions such as visit website, copy/paste, and even runs cells in the "execute" file to compute relevant numbers.
The "Merger" file combines the PDFs based on criterion like Unit, HW, Course, etc. for easy printing.
